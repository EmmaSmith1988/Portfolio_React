# Portfolio

------------------
This is my Portfolio, coded using React
------------------


## Capabilities
All information is on one page - you can scroll up and down, or use the links in the nav bar at the top to jump to a particular section. There are 2 carousels to scroll through my projects and my work experience, as well as links to my repositories, CV, LinkedIn site and any live versions of my listed projects.


## It looks like this:
